# Anagram task
# Given a string your function should return ALL anagrams of that string.
# An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once (Wikipedia)
# For this task, we are only interested in those anagrams that appear in the dictionary. 
# The dictionary you will use is the "SNL felles ord" (about 65000 words).
